## Business Objective 📍
Understanding the revenue channels obtained through the relationship between agent activities and customer information in order to gain data insights

## Dataset 📜
This dataset contains numbers about the performance and the net profit achieved through agent operations, as well as the performance resulting from the relationship between agent activities and customers.

## Logic 🎲
Before beginning to create the dashboard, it is necessary to plan and identify the objective of the audience. To clarify my main point, I proceeded with the Logic tree. It contains two main points. 
<p> The first is the agent's behavior data, which includes information from the call, such as a successful call or a pitch call relating to revenue generation. The second is customer data, which has a relationship to income generation.

### Insights 💡

1. The main source of actual revenue is the new customer.
	According to the dashboard, customer loyalty from new clients is higher than that of existing clients, with new clients purchasing at 100% compared to existing clients (33%).
2. The main customer to earn an income is customer tier C.
Customer tier C produces 45 % of revenue. It would benefit the company if we could connect with them more frequently via remarketing or campaigns.
3. No customer pitching did result in a successful deal.
The strategy of contacting clients must avoid pitching calls because the actual revenue was 67% from non-pitching customers.
4. Connecting with a new client to harvest new opportunities 
According to the opportunity stage, the new client represents the second opportunity stage (41%), which means we must connect and communicate with them in order to meet their needs, close a deal, and then fulfill customer loyalty.
